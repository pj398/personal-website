If you need someone with academic expertise and research skills, I may be able to help.

I can provide a range of independent research and scholarship services including proofreading, data entry, data cleaning, data analysis, report writing, tuition, training, bibliography management and project management.

If you want to take a look at examples of my work, I have many publications including book chapters, peer-reviewed journal articles, curated datasets and R packages (see the links on my home page).

### Why work with me

I'm a big advocate of open science and free and open source software, so my workflows prioritise reproducibility and transparency.
This means that if I do a job for you, I'll be able to hand over not just some results but the means to recreate or replicate them yourself.
I work primarily in R, which I've been programming in for around a decade.

Maybe you have some data that you want to analyse but you're not sure where to start or how to get the data in the right state for analysis.
Or maybe you want some visualisations or a report produced.
I can help with these types of tasks!
My day to day involves lots of data cleaning and processing as well as academic writing, so I can do this work quickly and effectively.

I also love teaching programming and data analysis tools to newcomers, particularly those coming from non-technical social sciences or humanities backgrounds that want to expand their research capabilities.
