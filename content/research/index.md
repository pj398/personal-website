### Current projects

I recently completed my PhD at the University of Manchester. The thesis is titled "A social network analysis approach to examining gendered character positions in popular film narratives". For more info and to take a look at the notebooks, check out the [project repository](https://github.com/pj398/between-the-lines). The data can be found in the [movienetData](https://github.com/pj398/movienetData) package.

I am currently working on the [EmpoderaData](https://datapopalliance.org/empoderadata-project/) project which is exploring data fellowships as a platform for building data literacy skills in Latin America in the context of sustainable development.
