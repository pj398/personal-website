Since 2021 I have been working with the [Kinomatics](https://kinomatics.com/) research collective on a variety of projects using social network analysis and computational methods to study inequities in the global screen industries. Much of this work has taken place at the University of Alberta as part of the [Centre for Analysis of Relational Data](https://kinomatics.com/about/card-lab/) (CARD), and continues as I look for a new home for my research activities.

In my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Alberta I worked on the social network analysis subproject team of the international [GEP-Analysis project](https://kinomatics.com/gepanalysis/). The subproject looked at the gendered collaboration patterns of key creatives in the film industries of Canada, the UK and Germany. We also simulated several policy-related "what if" scenarios and tested their impact on changing the gendered power structures in the networks. A summary of this work can be found on the [Kinomatics website](https://kinomatics.com/gep_networks/) and in the project's [final report](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-filmuniversitaet/frontdoor/index/index/docId/390). 

The other main strand of my research explores relational perspectives and tools for analysing the narrative marginalisation of women in popular Hollywood cinema. A concise (1,000 word) intro to this work can be found [here](https://femquant.squarespace.com/blog/2020/5/25/character-networks-and-the-narrative-marginalisation-of-women-in-popular-cinema), as well as in the journal articles listed below. All the data can be found in the [movienetdata](https://codeberg.org/pjphd/movienetdata) package, and the tools are implemented in the [charinet](https://codeberg.org/pjphd/charinet) package for R.

### Previous work

I was an ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Manchester's Department of Social Statistics from 2020-2021, further developing my doctoral research through the project [Exploring the marginalisation of women in popular cinema using quantitative network tools](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FV011472%2F1). 

Prior to this, I worked on the [EmpoderaData](https://datapopalliance.org/empoderadata-project/) project which is exploring data fellowships as a platform for building data literacy skills in Latin America in the context of sustainable development.

I received my PhD from the University of Manchester. The thesis is titled "A social network analysis approach to examining gendered character positions in popular film narratives" and can be found [here](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/a-social-network-analysis-approach-to-examining-gendered-character-positions-in-popular-film-narratives(76aa86f6-1c00-4d01-830f-1e6dafe4d798).html). 

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Social Research Methods and Statistics and a BA in Social Sciences, both at the University of Manchester.
