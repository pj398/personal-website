### Current projects

I am currently working as a postdoc at the University of Alberta on the international [GEP-Analysis project](https://kinomatics.com/gepanalysis/), where we are using network analysis to build understanding of the effects of gender equity policies on the structures and practices of women's participation in the global screen industries.

The other main strand of my research explores relational perspectives and tools for analysing the narrative marginalisation of women in popular Hollywood cinema. A concise (1,000 word) intro to this work can be found [here](https://femquant.squarespace.com/blog/2020/5/25/character-networks-and-the-narrative-marginalisation-of-women-in-popular-cinema), as well as in the journal articles listed below. All the data can be found in the [movienetData](https://github.com/pj398/movienetData) package, and the tools are implemented in the [charinet](https://github.com/pj398/charinet) package for R.

I also recently worked on the [EmpoderaData](https://datapopalliance.org/empoderadata-project/) project which is exploring data fellowships as a platform for building data literacy skills in Latin America in the context of sustainable development.

### CV

I was an ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Manchester's Department of Social Statistics from 2020-2021, further developing my doctoral research through the project [Exploring the marginalisation of women in popular cinema using quantitative network tools](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FV011472%2F1).

I received my PhD from the University of Manchester. The thesis is titled "A social network analysis approach to examining gendered character positions in popular film narratives" and can be found [here](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/a-social-network-analysis-approach-to-examining-gendered-character-positions-in-popular-film-narratives(76aa86f6-1c00-4d01-830f-1e6dafe4d798).html). 

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Social Research Methods and Statistics and a BA in Social Sciences, both at the University of Manchester.
