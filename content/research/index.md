### Current projects

I am currently working (short term) on the [EmpoderaData](https://datapopalliance.org/empoderadata-project/) project which is exploring data fellowships as a platform for building data literacy skills in Latin America in the context of sustainable development.

Prior to this, I received my PhD from the University of Manchester. The thesis is titled "A social network analysis approach to examining gendered character positions in popular film narratives" and can be found [here](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/a-social-network-analysis-approach-to-examining-gendered-character-positions-in-popular-film-narratives(76aa86f6-1c00-4d01-830f-1e6dafe4d798).html). 

A more concise (1,000 word) intro to my work on gender in film can be found [here](https://femquant.squarespace.com/blog/2020/5/25/character-networks-and-the-narrative-marginalisation-of-women-in-popular-cinema). All the data can be found in the [movienetData](https://github.com/pj398/movienetData) package.
