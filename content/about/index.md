### Bio

I'm a quantitatively trained social scientist currently finishing up a PhD at the University of Manchester. My research explores what the relational perspectives and tools of social network analysis can add to our understanding of the narrative marginalisation of women in popular Hollywood cinema.

### Education

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Social Research Methods and Statistics and a BA in Social Sciences, both at the University of Manchester.
