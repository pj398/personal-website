Iâ€™m a quantitatively trained social scientist currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities having completed my PhD at the University of Manchester. My research explores relational perspectives and tools for analysing the narrative marginalisation of women in popular Hollywood cinema.

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Social Research Methods and Statistics and a BA in Social Sciences, both at the University of Manchester.
